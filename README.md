I'm Ross, a Software Engineer based in Bristol, UK.

I talk like I belong in the movie Hot Fuzz, which is not surprising seeing as it was filmed just a few miles from where I grew up.

I work on software that improves the customer experience of contact centres worldwide. I mainly focus on web and front-end, but am always looking to deepen my knowledge.

When I'm not working, I mainly:

- Contribute to open source projects 💻
- Build and tinker with custom keyboards ⌨️
- Play guitar and bass 🎸
- Cook meals for my other half 🧑‍🍳
- Care for my pet hedgehog 🦔

### Current Tech Stack

My preferred tech stack is currently something like:

- Remix / Next.js
- TypeScript
- Radix UI
- TailwindCSS
- Cypress
- Vitest
- Prisma
- PlanetScale / Supabase
