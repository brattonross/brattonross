Hey there, I'm Ross, a Software Engineer from the UK.

I spend weekdays at my job developing software (primarily using .NET and Vue.js), and my free time doing all sorts, such as:

- Contributing to open source projects 🤝
- Building custom keyboards ⌨
- Developing websites for clients 👨‍💻
- Being active in various Twitch communities 💜
- Jamming out on guitar 🎸
- Working on super secret projects 👀
