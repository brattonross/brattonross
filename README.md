Hi, I'm Ross

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer based in Bristol, UK.

Here's some tech that I enjoy using:

- React
- Next.js
- Vue
- Nuxt.js
- TypeScript
- .NET / ASP.NET Core
- Go
- TailwindCSS

And here's some that I would like to learn:

- Svelte
- Vim
- CSS-in-JS (Stitches/Vanilla Extract)

In my free time I'm a custom keyboard enthusaist, guitarist, bassist, open source contributor, and hedgehog owner.
