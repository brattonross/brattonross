I'm Ross, a Software Engineer based in Bristol, UK.

I enjoy spending my time working on front-end web applications using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. If I'm in a back-end kind of mood, I find it fun to build .NET applications using clean architecture and DDD principals. I'm also known to do some devops work from time to time.
